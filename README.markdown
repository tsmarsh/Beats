# Beats ##

## Synopsis ##

A mini project to give a concrete example of how to turn good java
script in to great javascript / coffeescript.

## Purpose ##

Take beats.js and translate it in to a reusable 'flipper' widget for
displaying Swatch Internet Time.

The original JS is stolen mercilessly from: [Flip Clock](http://atomicnoggin.ca/test/flip-clock.html?reset)

It is pretty nice JS, but I think we can do better. 

Plus, I want a [Swatch Internet Clock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatch_Internet_Time clock)

## To do ##

* Add jasmin test file
* Actually use TDD
